## Overview
Morels is mainly a card game consisting of six different 
types of cards as well as Stick Tokens.
The deck will consist of Night Cards, Mushroom Cards,
Cider and Butter Cards, Frying Pan Cards, and Moon Cards.
There will also be Stick Tokens that they can buy with 
their Mushroom Cards.

## Why I chose Morels
I found Morels about a year ago and ever since then I’ve been
hooked! I wanted to share and enjoy it with my online community,
but sadly couldn’t since everyone is overseas.
When the time came to choose a project for my final assignment
I really wanted to make something that I could enjoy with my
online community, so I decided on Morels because it’s one of
my favorite games. I’m hoping to expand the website to create
more multiplayer games that user from all over the 
world can play and enjoy.

## TODO

6. Add Moon, Basket, and and Destroying Angel back into game
7. Tell who winner is when game is over
